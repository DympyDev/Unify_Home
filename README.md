# Unify Home #
This is an opensource Android Launcher, or Homescreen replacement app, developped by Dymion Fritz.
The goal of this project is to create a new experience for users by allowing them to categorize their application on their homescreen.
## That's cool and all, but why? ##
Well, my head is a mess, and so was my Homescreen. 

When I started working on Unify Home, there were no other options available on the Google Play Store. Since I am a Software Engineer who taught himself how to develop Android Apps, I thought it would be a neat idea to start a big project to test my skills.

As of today, the Launcher is available for download on the Google Play Store, the link will follow as soon as Google has approved the application.
## Okay, but why is called Unify Home ##
Good question, and it has an answer that goes way back..

About a year or 2 ago, I decided I wanted to create my own aftermarket firmware for Android phones. At the time being this firmware was called RA-Mod. This project kinda died after a few months of development because I was quite occupied with school. Half a year ago I found some old notes of the project, and I decided to revive the project, but using a different name: Android Unify.

It was going to be a skin, like HTC Sense or Samsung Touchwiz, but better. It would be different and it would unify a number of services, such as social media services, but also things like the media player.
This project is still a work in progress, but I had a lot of free time on my hands in the summer of 2013, so I decided to finish the Launcher.
## Ah, that explains a bit, any further plans? ##
Yes! At the moment the app can only be used in portrait mode, but I'm working on a landscape mode. The app also doesn't support Widgets yet, but that's also in the works!

When these basic features are implemented, I plan on adding something Oppo has implemented in their own Launcher, they call it Exclusive Spaces. These Exclusive Spaces are fullscreen widgets, and I plan on creating my own and create a library for third party apps.
## Cool, but where can I get it? ##
